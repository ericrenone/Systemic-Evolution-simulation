# Model of Systemic Evolution


This repository contains a **first-principles simulation framework** of the **Grand Canonical Model of Systemic Evolution**, representing the evolution of organized complexity in a system through a **Hilbert space of information**. 

The framework abstracts away cultural and biological dependencies to focus on **mathematical invariants**:

- **S₁ (Inference Primitive):** Logic, optimized for Shannon information density.  
- **S₂ (Persistence Substrate):** Mass, infrastructure, or memory that stabilizes the system.  
- **S₃, S₄, S₅ (Operators):** Transport, Gating, and Optimization — fuse logic and substrate into a **self-optimizing latent state**.  
- **Ω (Synthetic Transition):** Converged global state representing coherent, algorithmic autonomy.  

This simulation demonstrates the **KWFR (Koopman-Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao) path integral**, modeling the evolution of a system from inference to global synthesis.
